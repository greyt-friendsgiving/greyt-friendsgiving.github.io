Other event ideas to possibly incorporate:

  Relays

  Frisbee toss

  "Wet tee shirt contest

  It is a running event.   Dogs & handlers run from a starting line to a kiddie pool full of water and extra large human tee shirts.   They have to pull the soaking wet tee shirts out of the water, wrestle then on to the greyhound & then run back to the finish line.     Great for hot days!   "

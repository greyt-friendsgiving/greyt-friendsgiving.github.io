While the GREYT Friendgiving is just a bunch of Greyhounds and their human slaves descending on a location for a weekend of fun, it's great to be able to organize some of our fun together.  Currently the primary event will be a Pot-luck Thanksgiving Dinner together.  We are also discussing having some other possible activities such as a GREYT Migration Walk and GREYT Games.

To get started:
  - Reserve your RV spot or Cabin (limited availabilty) with our wonderful camp hosts linked here: [Book your stay at Oak Hammock Resort](https://www.oakhammock-resort.com/book-your-stay)
  - Fill out our quick survey to help us organize head/hound counts, emergency information and events linked here: [GREYT survey](https://forms.office.com/r/u2LkDH73fn)
  - Check out the [Location Page]({% link location.md %}) for tips on your arrival.

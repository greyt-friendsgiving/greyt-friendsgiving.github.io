#### Arriving with an RV Direction Tips:

For most of our friends, you will be arriving from the south.  Using a route that uses US17 and Tindle Camp Rd is the safest for most rigs.  It is a little bumpier but avoids neighborhoods with winding narrow roads and low trees.

- Use a route that will take you to US17
- From the south, you will turn right on Tindle Camp Rd (it's a hill in FL)
- Your first stop sign (about 1-2 miles), make a left on to Lake Mabel Loop Rd (through the orange groves we go)
- The first 3-way to the right will be Canal Rd.  (You will see a small irrigation shed on your left and then a agricultural building as you approach where the intersection is)
- There will be about 2 hills and then there will be a bumpy section of paved road in a 40MPH zone.  Going slower with an RV is recommended.
